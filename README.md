# Caltech beamer theme
######A LaTeX beamer theme using Caltech logo and color

### How to use this theme
The syntax is very easy; simply insert the following command in the LaTeX preamble:
```{tex}
\usetheme[<option>]{Caltech}
```
where `<option>" should be substituted with one of these three options: `minimal`, `sidebarleft`, or `sidebarright`. It is not recommended to leave the `<option>` blank, because the slides would have no Caltech logo.

An example `.tex` template has been included (`caltech_beamer_template.tex`), which can produce the three example PDF documents in this repository.

### How does this theme look like
##### 1. The `minimal` style
This style has the Caltech logo on the bottom-right corner, and slide titles in Caltech orange. This style is named "minimal" because there are minimal decorations on it. This style looks good in both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios.

##### 2. The `sidebarleft` ("side bar left") style
This style has a side bar on the left, which shows the structure of the presentation (e.g., abbreviated title, table of contents, etc.). The Caltech logo is on the top-left corner. The use of 16:9 aspect ratio is recommended, since the side bar takes up some horizontal space, and also most of the projectors these days support 16:9 ratio.
